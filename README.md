# 🚀 LaunchPad

A beautiful, modern macOS application launcher with glass morphism design, inspired by macOS Launchpad but with enhanced functionality and customization. As you might know, Apple removed Launchpad in macOS 26. This app offers a complete replacement with more features and a fully customizable, persistent grid.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📥 **First Launch**
1. App scans `/Applications` and `/System/Applications`
2. Apps sorted alphabetically by default
3. Drag & drop to customize layout
4. Create folders by dragging apps together
5. All changes auto-saved

### 💡 **Daily Usage**
- **Search**: Type to filter instantly
- **Navigate**: Arrow keys, dots, or scroll
- **Launch**: Click any app icon
- **Organize**: Drag to rearrange or create folders
- **Rename**: Click folder names
- **Exit**: Press ESC, activate another app, or click the Launchpad dock icon when already open

### 📦 **Importing from Old macOS Launchpad**

If you've used the native macOS Launchpad before and have customized your app layout, you can import it:

1. Open Settings (CMD + ,)
2. Go to the **Actions** tab
3. Click **Import from Old Launchpad**
4. Your existing layout will be imported automatically

**How it works:**
- Reads your existing Launchpad database at `/private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db`
- Preserves your app positions and page organization
- Maintains folder structures and names
- Merges with newly discovered apps not in old layout

**Note:** This feature requires that you have previously used and customized the native macOS Launchpad. If the database is not found, the import will fail gracefully.

## 🏗️ **Technical Overview**

### 🌍 **Localization**
- English and Hungarian translations
- Easy to add new languages
- Centralized string management

### 📦 **Requirements**
- macOS 15.6 or later
- Swift 6.0
- Universal binary (Apple Silicon + Intel)

## 🎹 AppleScript Integration

Create a keyboard shortcut using BetterTouchTool or similar:

![BetterTouchTool Config](Documentation/Launchpad-8.png)

```applescript
set appName to "Launchpad"

tell application "System Events"
	if name of processes contains appName then
		if visible of application process appName is true then
			set visible of application process appName to false
		else
			tell me to tell application appName to activate
		end if
	else
		tell me to tell application appName to activate
		set visible of application process appName to true
	end if
end tell
```
